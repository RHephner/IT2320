				<h2 class="introheader">Hello! My name is Ryan Hephner.</h2>
				<div class="intropara">I chose this site to discuss my two of my favorite interests, skiing and kayaking! </div>

		<div class="Skiing">

				<h2>Skiing</h2>
				<div class="skipara">I started skiing not long after I learned to walk, with my first time down the bunny slope was when I was 2 years old. I was hooked ever since!
					 I have been fortunate enough to ski some great areas in the Rocky Mountains, such as Winter Park CO, and Alta UT. This time of year would usually involve trips to Boston Mills, however the weather has not cooperated!</div>

		</div>
		<div class="Kayaking">
				<h2>Kayaking</h2>
				<div class="kayakpara">When it's too warm to ski, I enjoy going out on lake erie and kayaking the shores. I bought my first Kayak in high school and thoroughly enjoy
						paddling the coastlines of nearby bays. When visiting family in Florida, renting a kayak for a day to paddle the estuaries and mangroves is a go to activity! </div>
